# Final Project

An exercise to put to practice software development teamwork, subsystem communication, containers, deployment, and CI/CD pipelines. See [instructions](./instructions.md) for details.

## README Instructions
- a plain-language description of your project, including:
- badges at the top of the README.md file showing the result of the latest CI/CD of each subsystem.
- links to the container images for each custom subsystem, hosted on DockerHub.
- ~~the names of all teammates as links to their GitHub profiles.~~
- instructions for how to configure and run all parts of your project for any developer on any platform - these instructions must work!
- instructions for how to set up any environment variables and import any starter data into the database, as necessary, for the system to operate correctly when run.
- if there are any "secret" configuration files, such as .env or similar files, that are not included in the version control repository, examples of these files, such as env.example, with dummy data must be included in the repository and exact instructions for how to create the proper configuration files and what their contents should be must be supplied to the course admins by the due date.

## Project Description
Our project is a Blackjack casino game. Users can play versus the computer/dealer and see if they beat the dealer or bust out. Play as many times as you want!
